    <p>Three of the famous Indian sweets makers of Indore - Agrawal Sweets, Madhuram Sweets, and Gangaur Sweets - have their big outlets here !!  
    The mornings and days are business-as-usual, and evenings are happening and colourful as when youngsters, singles, couples, and families keep hopping from one food joint to the other, savouring their favourite foods !! Then, for the enjoyment of kids, there are various options including pony-rides, camel-rides, small swings, balloon shooting, etc., which keep changing from time to time !! There are a whole lot of convenience shops too, here !! 

    You might wonder why has this place been named as Chappan Dukan, which literally means 56 shops !! Originally, when the market started, there were actually 56 shops here and thus the name !! However, as time passed by, some of the retailers sold their shops to the ones next-door, who wanted to make their shops bigger !! Even today, if you count the number of pillars between the shops, you'll actually see that there are exactly 56 shops !! </p>
